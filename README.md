# Smoker-Detection-classification
This project focuses on developing a classification model for detecting smokers using a dataset of 1,120 images. The dataset is evenly divided into two classes: 560 images of smokers and 560 images of non-smokers. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to analyze these images, enabling accurate classification of individuals as smokers or non-smokers.
